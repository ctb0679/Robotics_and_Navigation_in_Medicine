# Weekly Report Week 5.6 - 11.6
Finished camera calibration and robot trajectory execution in the lab. Divided the rest of the work more precisely and drafted API structure.

## Contributions
- Alexander Busch: Implement and correct camera calibration and integrate into API; developed a drafted API structure for the final project
- Yu Tung Tsai: Do research on model registration
- Berk Ali Cam: Working on transforming current trajectory into time-optimal trajectory, research for a suitable path-planning algorithm
- Junaidali Surti: Conducted research on the process of stitching together 3D point clouds.
- Mahek Panchal: Started work on Model recording and registration (WP 5)

## Problems
- Listening to the camera topic from the azure throws Timeout-Error
