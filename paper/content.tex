Our implemented procedure contains the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Photo recording for camera calibration. The RGBD - camera is mounted onto the robot endeffector and a checkerboard of known dimensions is placed at the working table. The robot is then moved through a number of different positions. At each position, RGB and infrared photos are taken and stored with the current robot configuration.
    \item Calculation of camera calibration and hand-eye calibration. Using an OpenCV procedure, corners of the checkerboard in both infrared and RGB-images are detected. A standard camera calibration applied for each corners from the respective camera gives the intrinsic camera matrices and estimates of 3D-corner points of the checkerboard. A stereo calibration is now applied to yield the relative transformation between the RGB and infrared cameras. The estimates of the 3D corner points are then used to calculate the transformation from the endeffector to the camera.
    \item Phantom Recording. The checkerboard is replaced with the phantom body model at the workplace. The robot now traverses a set of positions to capture the target ball. At each position, a colored pointcloud generated by the camera driver is stored with its current position.
    \item Target estimation. Each pointcloud is transformed into base coordinates using the camera-endeffector transformation and robot pose. The points are then filtered by color comparison with statistical outliers being removed to obtain a set of ball points.
    \item Needle insertion. A straight cartesian path from the current robot position to the estimated center of the ball is taken and fine-sampled. For each point, close joint configurations are calculated and a quintic polynomial spline is used to connect the fine-sampled positions in the configuration space. The needle is then attached to the robot endeffector and moved using the quintic spline path.
